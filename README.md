This interactive web application provides a simple way to assess a personâ€™s motor and scanning abilities in order to determine an appropriately sized grid for setting up an AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) device.

An AAC device with an appropriately sized grid should enable the user to access all buttons or keys of the device based on their operational  competence (motor skills, fine motor skills, gross motors) and selection method (touch, point, eye scan, joystick).

### Usage

Grid Therapy was designed for use on tablets, but may also be used on desktop computers. 

* Tap or click on the grid cell with the circular target. 
* Each level has a fixed grid size.
* Each level has 5 stages.
* Complete every level and assess your results at the end.
